# üöÄ The earthquake at a glance 

The `1992 Roermond earthquake` occurred on April 13, 1992, at 3:20 local time, with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 5.3 and a maximum intensity of VIII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale. The earthquake's epicenter was located near Roermond in the southeastern Netherlands. Roermond and nearby areas in the Dutch Limburg province, along with parts of neighboring Germany, were the most affected regions. Economic losses exceeded 50 million USD. Fortunately, no fatalities were reported, though around 45 people sustained injuries. There were reports of landslides and liquefaction triggered by the earthquake, though no evidence of fires or tsunamis was observed. This event remains one of the most significant seismic occurrences in the Netherlands' history.

## Estimated and observed ground shaking

The folder [OpenQuake_gmfs](./OpenQuake_gmfs/) contains the input files required to generate ground motion fields, considering different rupture solutions and conditioning the ground shaking to the recording stations for the event, where available. The figures below present an example of the results, illustrating the median ground motion fields with and without conditioning. These results are based on the rupture and ground motion model that demonstrates the lowest nominal bias. The maximum reported Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) was 0.25 g. If no seismic station data were available for the event, the generated ground motion fields are shown without conditioning to recording stations, as illustrated in the figures.
